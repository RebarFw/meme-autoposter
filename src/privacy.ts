  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: <time datetime="2026-10-01">October 1, 2026</time></p>

  <p>Meme Autoposter is a private automation operated by the owner of its connected Instagram and TikTok meme accounts. It processes Instagram messages to repost videos that the owner has permission to share.</p>

  <h2>Information we process</h2>
  <p>Instagram sends message events through Meta's API. These can include sender and recipient account IDs, a message ID, a timestamp, message text, and shared media URLs, IDs or captions. The app checks the sender against the owner's approved account. Messages from other senders do not create publishing jobs or posts.</p>
  <p>The owner has enabled scheduled API reads, normally once per minute, of the conversation with the approved personal account. During sender setup, an authenticated administrator may check a limited number of recent messages to match the exact setup message and selected username. Unrelated message contents are discarded. Signed webhook notifications are also validated, but only one ingestion method creates publishing jobs at a time.</p>
  <p>For an approved Reel, we process the video, generate a short caption, and store job status, channel IDs and Buffer post IDs to track publication and prevent duplicate posts. Access tokens and API keys are stored as Cloudflare Worker secrets.</p>

  <h2>How we use information</h2>
  <p>We use this information to verify authorized requests, obtain the shared video, publish it to the owner's connected channels, confirm publication, resolve errors and delete temporary files. If enabled, the app sends the owner a completion message through Instagram. We do not sell personal information or use message data for advertising.</p>

  <h2>Services that receive information</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Meta / Instagram:</strong> provides authorized conversation and message reads, signed message events, media and optional message replies.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloudflare:</strong> hosts the app, stores job records, and temporarily stores videos in a private R2 bucket.</li>
    <li><strong>Buffer:</strong> receives the video through an expiring link, its caption and the selected channel information to publish to Instagram and TikTok.</li>
    <li><strong>An optional downloader provider:</strong> if configured by the owner, receives the Reel URL or media information needed to obtain the video.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Published videos and captions are visible according to the Instagram and TikTok accounts' settings. These providers process information under their own policies, including <a href="https://www.facebook.com/privacy/policy/">Meta's Privacy Policy</a>, <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/eea/privacy-policy/en">TikTok's Privacy Policy</a>, <a href="https://buffer.com/legal#privacy-policy">Buffer's Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/">Cloudflare's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

  <h2>Storage and retention</h2>
  <p>Temporary videos are deleted after both posts are confirmed as sent, or when they are no longer needed after a known failure. Video access links normally expire after 24 hours. Cleanup removes expired or stuck files, with a separate R2 rule that expires the app's files after two days; physical deletion may take additional time to complete.</p>
  <p>Stored source message details, media URLs and generated captions are normally removed about two days after a job finishes or is marked for attention. Minimal job hashes, recipient and channel IDs, publication records and error codes are retained to prevent duplicates and support operation. Polling retains a small bounded set of message hashes and operational timestamps. The one-time sender setup stores a hash of its authorization code and the verified sender ID; this temporary proof is removed after setup completes or its 15-minute validity expires. The approved sender ID and credentials are retained until the owner replaces or removes them. Service logs and provider backups follow the applicable service's retention settings.</p>
  <p>Deleting the app's temporary copy does not delete a video already published on Instagram or TikTok, or copies retained by those services.</p>

  <h2>Security and website visits</h2>
  <p>The app validates Meta webhook signatures and accepts publishing requests only from the approved sender. Video storage is private, and temporary download links require an expiring access token. Operational logs avoid message content, source URLs and secrets.</p>
  <p>This privacy page sets no cookies and includes no analytics or tracking scripts. Cloudflare may process technical information such as IP addresses and request metadata to deliver and protect the service.</p>

  <h2 id="contact">Contact and deletion requests</h2>
  <p>To ask about this policy or request access, correction or deletion of information processed by Meme Autoposter, contact the owner by direct message to the Instagram meme account that you messaged. Start your message with <strong>“Meme Autoposter privacy request”</strong> and describe your request. The owner may need to verify your identity before acting on it.</p>
  <p>To request removal of a published video, identify the Instagram or TikTok post in your message. You can also revoke the app's access through your account's app permissions settings.</p>

  <h2>Changes to this policy</h2>
  <p>Updates will be published on this page with a revised date.</p>
